# Update downloader design discussion

This document describes the problem of downloading and installing
software updates in cryptokami-core and suggests possible design.

## The problem

In cryptokami-core we have Update System (sometimes abbreviated to US)
which allows stakeholders to propose software updates and vote for
them. Update proposals and votes are stored in the blockchain and thus
are publicly visible by all nodes. Update proposal may become
**confirmed** if it gets enough votes and on top of those votes (which
are stored in blocks) there are enough blocks (to make those blocks
practically irrevertible). We are primarily interested in events when
update proposal becomes **confirmed**, because it means that software
for which that update is proposed should be updated.

`UpdateProposal` contains, among other things, `HashMap SystemTag
UpdateData`. `SystemTag` is used to distinguish operating systems,
currently `win64` and `macos64`. `UpdateData` contains various hashes,
but we are primarily interested in only one of them: hash of the
installer which can be used to install the updated software.

Let's assume that our software is called `csl-daedalus` for simplicty,
because currently only this software uses this feature (automatic
downloading of updates). There are the following requirements:
1. If after processing a block an update proposal for `csl-daedalus`
   becomes **confirmed** and it has an update for our `SystemTag`:
   * We should:
      1. Download the installer corresponding to this update proposal and
         save it on disk so that it can be launched later. The URL to
         download the installer is formed from the predefined template and
         the hash of the installer.
      2. Verify the hash of the downloaded installer.
      3. Notify frontend about it (if previous steps are successful).

2. If we process a lot of blocks and multiple update proposals get
   confirmed, only the last installer should be downloaded.
3. It should be possible to specify multiple servers and if one fails
   (or hangs), try another one.
4. The update download procedure must not hang indefinitely. If
   download takes too much time, it should be restarted after delay
   or using another server (see above).
5. If the installer is downloaded succesfully, then when user opens
   Daedalus next time, the installer should be launched automatically
   and update Daedalus.

There are two options for (1):

* 1.1. If we have already downloaded an update we can ignore all new
updates until the downloaded one is installed (which happens on restart).
* 1.2. [Optional] Ideally we shouldn't ignore all new updates, but
instead utilize newer update if it's possible. Though this one is questionable.

## Current approach

We have a worker defined in `Pos.Update.Worker` module
(`checkForUpdate`) which checks whether there is a new **confirmed**
update for our application and tries to download it if it exists. This
check happens once per slot and only when we are not in recovery
mode.
* First we obtain all confirmed proposals for our application from
  GState. We only consider updates for our `SystemTag`.
* We pick the proposal with the greatest numeric software version and
  try to download it.
* Download procedure is guarded by `MVar ()` which allows only one
  thread to download an update.
* We store information about already downloaded update in `MVar`
  (`ucDownloadedUpdate`). If we have already downloaded one, we don't
  download anything. We assume that on start there is no downloaded
  update.
* We also check whether the update we are about to download has been
  installed already. It generally must not happen, but it can happen
  due to a bug. This information is stored in Misc DB.
* There is a predefined path where update should be downloaded. If
  there is a file with this path, we don't download the update.
* If we reach this step, we try to actually download the update. We
  know servers from which we can download the update and try them
  one-by-one until we download the installer. When we download it, we
  also check that its hash is the expected one.
     * NB: Servers are provided to node via command line.
* In the end we put information about downloaded update into `MVar`
  (`ucDownloadedUpdate`) and thus notify Daedalus.

Another part is maintenance of already downloaded update (launching
it, removing when it becomes unnecessary, etc.). It is handled by
`cryptokami-launcher`.
* Launcher knows the path where the installer is supposed to be stored.
* Before launching the node launcher checks whether the file with
  aforementioned path exists.
* If the file exists, the installer will be launched. The way to
  launch the installer is not described in this document.
* If the installer exits succesfully, we write about it into Misc DB
  (that we have succesfully launched the installer with hash
  `h`) and remove the installer.

Let's see which requirements are satisfied by this approach:
1. The first one is satisfied if we consider option 1.1.
2. The second one is satisfied because we don't use `checkForUpdate`
   worker in recovery mode and because there can't be more than one
   confirmed proposal for our application in `k` blocks.
3. The third one is satisfied, except that we don't have timeouts (see
   below).
4. The fourth one is not satisfied. We don't have timeouts and we once
   observed that update download never finished (after several hours
   or maybe even days). See CSL-1786.
5. The fifth one is satisfied completely.

So the only missing strict requirement is the fourth one (lack of
timeouts). Also we miss optional requirement 1.2.

Apart from that, there are several drawbacks in the implementation:
* We may download an update, save it on disk and then an exception may
  be thrown before we fill `MVar` (which is used to notify
  middleware). When we try to download an update again, we won't
  succeed, because we'll think that we have already downloaded one. So
  we'll never notify Daedalus until restart.
* It can happen that user's computer is turned off during the process
  of writing the update on disk (or cryptokami-node is stopped). In this
  case there will be malformed updated which will never succeed to
  apply. And update system will stop working for this user (we will
  see there is an update, but will always fail to apply it). According
  to @georgeee it's very unlikely to happen in practice, because
  writing the update on disk is simply calling `BSL.writeFile` with
  tens of megabytes and it should be quite fast. However, it's still
  possible and it would be good to completely prevent it from
  happening. Also it can happen that the user accidentally modifies
  the update file (also unlikely, but possible).

In terms of general design, these two drawbacks probably stem from two
more general problems:
1. We basically assume that writing installer on disk and updating
   `MVar` is a single action which happens atomically. But we don't
   have any guarantees about correspondence between the file on disk
   and the contents of `MVar`.
2. When we have an installer on disk, we don't know which installer
   it's supposed to be. We just assume that it's the one we want to
   install.

## Suggested improvements

To address the drawbacks of the current approach, I propose to do the
following changes:
1. Change the check whether we have already downloaded the installer
   in `downloadUpdateDo` function. If the file doesn't exist, we can
   simply proceed with download. If the file exists, there are two
   cases:
   * It contains the installer we want to download (it can be checked
     by hashing the file). In this case we don't need to download
     anything. We only need to ensure that `ucDownloadedUpdate` will
     contain proper value.
   * The hash of the file is not the one we want to download. In this
     case we delete this file immediately (because we don't need it
     anyway) and download the update we want.
2. [Optional] In order to solve the second drawback of the existing
   approach, we can store the hash of the installer we assume to be
   stored on disk in Misc DB. In this case we can check always check
   the installer's integrity. When we write the installer on disk, we
   first update the hash in Misc DB and only then do
   `BSL.writeFile`. When we want to check the launcher's integrity, we
   compare its hash with the one in Misc DB. If differs, we delete the
   installer and assume it doesn't exist.
3. Impose timeout on downloading function (`downloadUri`). If timeout
  occurs, try another server. If all servers fail, try again later.
4. Do not even start `checkForUpdateWorker` if the list of servers is
  empty (which is the case for core nodes).

## Open questions

1. Do we want to satisfy requirement 1.2? Probably not, 1.1 is enough.
2. Do we want to make improvement (2)? It's optional, because the
   drawback (2) is unlikely to happen in practice, but it looks easy
   to do, so I would do it.
